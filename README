More than your REPL

## The use case

While programming, many of us use a REPL, ruby, erlang etc,. have a good REPL.
However, some programming languages don't have a REPL and those which have will never allow my to modify my code in the way my editor does.

This plugin runs your file using the right compiler interpreter and show you the results in a readonly buffer at the bottom of your current window.

All you need to do is press Ctrl+d
